# Comparison between Boken Engine and other Interactive Stories technologies

Although Boken Engine is an open and extensible technology that can be used for a wide range of uses, it is great for developing Visual Stories or Interactive Fiction. Of course, there are already several well-established technologies to do so. And is great, because the goal is not to compete, but to be a different alternative.

What follows is a comparison between Boken Engine and other popular script languages and software:

## Ink

[Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) is a narrative scripting language very popular for creating non-linear stories. 
It is very easy to learn for simple scripts that can be described with a regular tree structure. More complex application (with text generation, interweaved paths, loops...) can also be made with deeper learning. 
Probably the most oustanding feature of Ink is the fine-grained control the creator can have over the dialogue and choices.
It does not include any built-it feature to add visual content to the story.

Compared with Boken, it is a more appropiate tool for creating text-only, narratively complex stories that does not require sound or images.

## Z-Machine

[Z-Machine](http://www.inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/z1point0/index.html) is a virtual machine format created by the game company Infocom. The games are distributed using binary files (sometimes called [Z-Code or Z5 files](http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Z-code))
There are several tools for creating Z-Machine content, like [Inform](http://inform7.com/), but in general, is a process very much tougher than using other scripts languages.

It is similar to Boken in the scope and features, but is more challenging to a non developer user. 

## Twine

[Twine](http://twinery.org/) is an open-source tool for creating interactive fiction that generates HTML files. Current version is based on Harlowe script language, more or less similar to Ink.
It is one of the most adopted technologies, and its visual editor makes it very easy to create the stories content. Although the new version does not have support for Images and Sound (previous version did), they can be manually embedded in the published files.

Although lacks some of the features of Boken Engine (like media support), its visual editor makes it a very appropiate tool for non developer users.
